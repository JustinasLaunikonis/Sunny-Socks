## The Project Website: Sunny Socks

We are developing a website for Sunny Socks to increase their brands digital presence. While the products and brand identity are already established, at the moment there is no online platform where customers can explore the brand story, mission, and their product. Sunny Socks is not just a sock brand, it is a brand focused on proving that positivity, color, and fairness can be designed to bring joy to everyday life. Therefore, the goal of this Project is to create a website that reflects their identity, be visually appealing, and user-friendly so that visitors understand what the brand stands for.

## Choice in workflow, workethics and codequality

For our current workflow, the group has decided to use Figma, Visual Studio Code, Useberry, OneDrive and GitHub. These were the first and only options considered, since they were suggested by both our Lecturers and Study Buddies. During project Ateliers, we help each other ensure that we all understand which issues we will divide and help each other with. We must also make sure everyone is abiding by the current Code of Conduct. All of these are examples of how we have taken steps to ensure that the quality of the code is good. Each code iteration is tested excessively to make sure the code works as intended.
